# Updating the Tool

## Updating Code

To apply any type of code update, you must rebuild the containers and start them again. 

Once you have the directory on your host machine populated with this new code, this can be accomplished via

```bash
./scripts/run rebuild
./scripts/run start
```

This will rebuild and start *all* containers.


## Updating Environment Variables

To apply changes to environment variables (e.g. in webapp.env, matcher.env, or .env files), you must remove and recreate the affected containers. For instance, if the `webapp.env` file is changed, you can apply these changes to the `webapp` container by:

```bash
docker-compose stop webapp
docker rm webapp
./scripts/run start
```


## Clearing a Master Table for a Schema

If column names, data types, or the primary key have changed in one of the schemas, you will have to delete the master table for that schema in the database. This is because once data has been uploaded for a particular schema, this master table will reflect the column names and data types present in the schema at that time, and all uploads are merged into this table for a coherent timeline of events. There is no procedure for 'upgrading' a master table with a new schema, because many schema updates will invalidate existing data. We recommend simply deleting the table and re-uploading any data.

The master table resides in the `{jurisdiction}_{event_type}_master` in the [Postgres database](troubleshooting.md#querying-the-database). Example: A jurisdiction of `cook`, and event type of `hmis_service_stays` would be stored in `cook_hmis_service_stays_master`. Once this table has been deleted, it will be recreated upon the next user upload with the new schema.


## User and Role Management

Access to the matching tool web application is handled with users and roles.

A **user** is anybody who can log into the tool.

A **role** is a specific function of the tool that can be accessed by users. In the matching tool, this is the combination of two things: A `jurisdiction` (e.g. your county) and `event_type` (e.g. hmis_service_stays).

The matching-tool repository comes with a convenience script for adding users and roles that aims to make the usual use case (one jurisdiction, with users who have access to many roles) easier. This was run as part of the [install docs](install.md), and you can use it later to add more users.

It is located in the repository path `/scripts/3_create_user`. To run it, you need the following information:

- A short, lowercase name for your jurisdiction (e.g. 'cook'). Don't include spaces as it will confuse the script. This is the name that is displayed to the user in the browser at the top of the screen. This should match whatever jurisdiction name that was picked on initial tool installation. If you don't know what this is, you can query the `public.role` table in the webapp database to see what role names exist.
- An email address for the web app login user
- A password for the web app login user
- A list of 'event types' that the user will have access to upload (e.g. `hmis_service_stays`, `jail_bookings`). If you want to see all the available event types, run the script without any to see the full list (e.g. `./scripts/3_create_user`)
Example: `./scripts/3_create_user mycounty thcrockett@uchicago.edu password hmis_service_stays jail_bookings`

The script tries to create all the resources it needs, even if they exist already, so when the script is running you may see some error messages indicating that roles already exist.

There are some management use cases that are unserved by this script, for instance removing roles from an existing user. If you want more direct control over users and roles, refer to the [webapp readme](https://github.com/dssg/matching-tool/blob/master/webapp/README.md).

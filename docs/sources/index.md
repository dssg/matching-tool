# Matching Tool Overview

## Background
The University of Chicago's Center for Data Science and Public Policy (DSaPP) collaborated with the Corporation for Supportive Housing (CSH) with funding from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation and the Corporation for National and Community Service to develop a matching tool to integrate data from the Criminal Justice system and the Homeless Management Information System (HMIS). 

DSaPP and CSH partnered with the following jurisdictions to standardize the development of the matching tool:
* Boone County, MO
* Clark County, NV
* McLean County, IL
* Salt Lake County, UT

## Purpose
The main purpose of the matching tool is to integrate data from the homeless services and criminal justice systems, which will allow a community to identify frequent users of both systems and provide intervention for those who need it the most.

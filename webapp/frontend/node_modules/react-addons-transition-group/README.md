# react-addons-transition-group

The code in this package has moved. We recommend you to use `TransitionGroup` from [`react-transition-group`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group) instead.

In particular, its version `1.x` is a drop-in replacement for the last released version of `react-addons-transition-group`.

Run `npm install --save react-transition-group@1.x`, and replace the imports in your code:

```js
// Old
import TransitionGroup from 'react-addons-transition-group';

// New
import TransitionGroup from 'react-transition-group/TransitionGroup';
```

The documentation branch for `react-transition-group@1.x` [can be found here](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group/tree/v1-stable#low-level-api-transitiongroup).

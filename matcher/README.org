* Quick setup

- Install `pyenv`, if you don't have it
- Create a /virtual environment/ called `csh`

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pyenv virtualenv 3.6.0 csh
#+END_SRC

- Activate the virtual environment that you just created

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pyenv activate csh
#+END_SRC


- Install the needed libraries

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
#+END_SRC

- If you are coding, probably you will need to execute the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
#+END_SRC

* Run the API

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
docker-compose up -d
#+END_SRC

You can test the API with

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
http 0.0.0.0:5001/poke
#+END_SRC

Also, there is a postgres container running, you can access it using:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
